# System images for CRES Dynamics

Add your **downloaded system screenshots** here. They will be used on the homepage in Tesla-style full-viewport sections.

## Suggested filenames

| File | Used in |
|------|--------|
| `hero.jpg` or `hero.webp` | Main hero background |
| `dashboard-erp.jpg` | CresOS / ERP section |
| `dashboard-finance.jpg` | Finance & Revenue section |
| `dashboard-ops.jpg` | Operations & Workflow section |
| `dashboard-ai.jpg` | AI & Automation section |

## Format

- **Aspect:** 16:9 or 3:2 (landscape) works best for full-width sections.
- **Format:** JPG or WebP; keep file size under ~500KB per image for fast load.

If a file is missing, the site will show a clean gradient fallback so the layout never breaks.
